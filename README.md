## Files list
* [effectors.ltx](https://github.com/rzc0d3r/Lost-Alpha-DC-Data/blob/main/gamedata/config/misc/effectors.ltx) - A configuration responsible for various effects, such as camera rotation when the protagonist sprints:
```
[bobbing_effector]
run_amplitude			=	0.0075
walk_amplitude			=	0.008
limp_amplitude			=	0.095
```
> Reducing the numbers in these lines of code help reduce the very large camera swings during a sprint.

> This file will need to be moved to folder with installed Lost Alpha DC/gamedata/config/misc
