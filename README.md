Lost-Alpha-DC-Effectors - Various useful files for S.T.AL.K.E.R. Lost Alpha DC

## Files list
* effectors.ltx - A configuration responsible for various effects, such as camera rotation when the protagonist sprints:
```
[bobbing_effector]
run_amplitude			=	0.0075
walk_amplitude			=	0.008
limp_amplitude			=	0.095
```
> Reducing the numbers in these lines of code help reduce the very large camera swings during a sprint
> This file will need to be moved to %Lost Alpha DC installed folder%/gamedata/config/misc
